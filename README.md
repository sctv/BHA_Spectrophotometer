#BHA Spectrophotometer

This repo contains the designs and source files of a **DIY Spectrophotometer**. This device, based on the TSL1402R IC, can be used to do a photospectral analysis of liquid samples, such as growth curve analysis. Check out the corresponding [BHA lecture in the Syllabus](http://biohackacademy.github.io) for more information.
